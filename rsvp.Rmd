```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

*__Important: No children__. Please note that although we would love to host your entire family, we unfortunately will not be able to accommodate children at the wedding. Thank you!*

Note: Our RSVP is a pretty simple form - if you're responding for more just yourself just write multiple names in the "Name(s)" field!
