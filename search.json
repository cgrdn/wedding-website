      "contents": "\nAre children allowed at the wedding?\nNo, unfortunately we cannot accommodate children at the wedding. Only named invitees please!\nWhat is the dress code?\nWe do not have a specific dress code and want you to dress in a way that you feel comfortable. Bridal party will be wearing black, but this should not limit you from wearing that color - just please refrain from wearing any black dresses from Park and Fifth to avoid matching someone exactly.\nWhat do I do between the ceremony and cocktail hour?\nThe short answer is, whatever you like! There is time to go back to your hotel, walk through the public gardens, or pop up the street to the Oxford Tap Room for a quick beer before the reception gets started.\nSt. Mary’s Boat Club is down the hill from the church and is a lovely area to walk. It holds many of the beautiful old Halifax homes along the Northwest Arm. If you’re a little early to the boat club, that is no problem! The deck overlooks the arm and is a lovely place to enjoy beautiful views and breathe in that fresh ocean air.\nWhat are the available accommodations?\nWe have a group rate of $219/night at the Cambridge Suites (1583 Brunswick St.).\n\n\n\n",
