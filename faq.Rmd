## Are children allowed at the wedding?

No, unfortunately we cannot accommodate children at the wedding. Only named invitees please!

## What is the dress code?

We do not have a specific dress code and want you to dress in a way that you feel comfortable, but also encourage you to dress up! Bridesmaids will be wearing black. 

## What do I do between the ceremony and cocktail hour?

The short answer is, whatever you like! There is time to go back to your hotel, walk through the public gardens, or pop up the street to the Oxford tap room for a quick beer before the reception gets started. 

St. Mary's boat club is just down the hill from the church, and that area is also a lovely place to walk to the Northwest Arm among some beautiful old Halifax homes. If you're a little early to the boat club that is no big deal! The deck overlooks the arm and is a lovely place to kill some time.
